This repository contains all the code to train CNNs to detect monsters from the board game Gloomhaven on video stream. From generating a synthetic dataset to preparing this data and train two models: MaskRCNN and YoloV5.

## Project structure

  * **Image Generator**: An UE4 project to generate synthetic images and the masks for training the models. A dataset of 10000 images is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ericdepotter/synthetic-gloomhaven-monsters).
  * **Images**: The base images of the monsters, their masks and the game tiles.
  * **MaskRCNN**: Code to prepare the generated images and train a MaskRCNN model.
  * **YoloV5**: Code to prepare the generated images and train a YoloV5 model.
  * **Visualize some test images**: A Jupyter notebook to visualize some images using annotations generated by the code in ```MaskRCNN```.
